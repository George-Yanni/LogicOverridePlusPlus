Personal archive of competitive programming problems that I find interesting, with a focus on clear reasoning and algorithm mastery. Each entry captures the source problem, a plain-English explanation of the solution, and a final C++ implementation.

## Purpose

`LogicOverride++` is a curated collection of problems that train algorithmic thinking. The goal is not just to solve, but to understand: why a solution works, how to derive it, and how to implement it cleanly in C++.

## Writeup Organization

Each problem writeup is concise and technical:

- **Reference**: link or citation to the original problem statement.
- **Explanation**: plain-English reasoning, key ideas, and proof sketch.
- **Implementation**: final C++ solution focused on correctness and clarity.

## Philosophy

Competitive programming rewards precision and disciplined thinking. This repo is built around the belief that strong solutions come from understanding first and coding second.

## Long-Term Growth

By collecting high-quality writeups and implementations over time, this archive becomes:

- a personal knowledge base of reusable patterns and techniques
- a measurable record of growth in reasoning and problem selection
- a reference for revisiting hard problems with better intuition



## Closing

This repository is a long-term project in algorithmic mastery—one problem at a time.
