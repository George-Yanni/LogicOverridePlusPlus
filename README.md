Personal archive of competitive programming problems that I find interesting, with a focus on clear reasoning and algorithm mastery. Each entry captures the source problem, a plain-English explanation of the solution, its difficulty level, and a C++ implementation.

## Purpose

`LogicOverride++` is a curated collection of problems that train algorithmic thinking. The goal is not just to solve, but to understand: why a solution works, how to derive it, and how to implement it cleanly in C++.

## Difficulty Levels [Subjective Rating]

Each problem is tagged with a difficulty based on my personal estimation:

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| E     | Easy – beginner-friendly problems, basic algorithms |
| M     | Medium – requires multiple concepts or small optimizations |
| H     | Hard – complex problems, advanced algorithmic thinking |
| H++   | Hard++ – very challenging, may require clever insights or tricky implementation |
| L     | Legendary – ultimate challenge, boss-tier problems that test full mastery |

## Writeup Organization

Each problem writeup is concise and technical:

- **Reference**: link or citation to the original problem statement.
- **Difficulty**: one of E, M, H, H++, or L.
- **Explanation**: plain-English reasoning, key ideas, and proof sketch.
- **Implementation**: final C++ solution focused on correctness and clarity.

## Philosophy

Competitive programming rewards precision and disciplined thinking. This repo is built around the belief that strong solutions come from understanding first and coding second.

## Long-Term Growth

By collecting high-quality writeups and implementations over time, this archive becomes:

- a personal knowledge base of reusable patterns and techniques
- a measurable record of growth in reasoning and problem selection
- a reference for revisiting hard problems with better intuition

## Closing

This repository is a long-term project in algorithmic mastery—one problem at a time.
